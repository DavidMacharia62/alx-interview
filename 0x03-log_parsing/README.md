Sure, let's create a detailed README file for the `0-stats.py` script. A README file typically provides information on how to use the script, what it does, and any other relevant details. Here's an example README for your script:

# Log Parsing Script

## Overview

This script reads log entries from stdin, computes metrics, and prints statistics based on the specified criteria. The input log format is expected to be `<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>`.

## Usage

```bash
./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
```

The script is designed to work with the output of `0-generator.py`, which generates sample log entries.

## Metrics Computed

1. **Total File Size**: Sum of all file sizes encountered.

2. **Number of Lines by Status Code**: Counts the occurrences of specific status codes (200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500) and prints them in ascending order.

## Output Example

```bash
File size: 5213
200: 2
401: 1
403: 2
404: 1
405: 1
500: 3
File size: 11320
200: 3
301: 2
400: 1
401: 2
403: 3
404: 4
405: 2
500: 3
...
```

The script prints the metrics after every 10 lines of input or when interrupted with CTRL + C.

## Notes

- If the input log format is not as expected, the script skips that line.
- The script handles keyboard interruptions (CTRL + C) gracefully and prints the statistics calculated up to that point.

## Sample Data Generation

The provided `0-generator.py` script generates random log entries for testing purposes. You can customize this script to generate your own sample data.

```bash
./0-generator.py > sample_logs.txt
```
